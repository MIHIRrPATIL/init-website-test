## 1. Violent Action Recognition

**Problem Statement:** Manual video surveillance takes time and is prone to human error. Thanks to machine learning and deep learning, video analytics automates these processes. Video classification is an important aspect of video analytics. It is critical to detect violent behaviour in recordings for surveillance, crime prevention, and public safety. Video classification algorithms are capable of detecting violent acts in video data. The classification of violent acts enhances public safety and crime prevention. This paper introduces readers to the many approaches to video classification and describes the underlying network structure of the 3DCNN, ConvLSTM, and LRCN models, which are commonly used for video classification. Additionally, the models' implementation results were compared in order to conduct a comparative performance analysis of the models for the task of violent action classification. When it comes to classification, F1 Score, AUC score, and accuracy are useful metrics for evaluating models, and they were compared. We discuss some of the difficulties in violent action classification, as well as some potential future opportunities and new perspectives on how to address them and improve the system.

## 2. Fleet Analysis Using FedML

**Problem Statement:** The objective of this project is to develop an ML model using federated learning technology that effectively calculates the risk score for drivers, vehicles, routes, and fleet telematics companies in comparison with other customers.To achieve this, the first step is to identify the relevant risk parameters and metrics for each entity. For drivers, these may include variables such as driving behaviour, accident history, and traffic violations. For vehicles, factors such as age, mileage, and maintenance records may be considered. For routes, variables such as traffic volume, weather conditions, and road quality may be relevant. Finally, for fleet telematics companies, metrics such as utilisation rates, maintenance costs, and fuel efficiency can be used to calculate risk scores.

Once the relevant risk parameters have been identified for each entity, appropriate algorithms are used to calculate the individual risk scores. For example, machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks may be used to predict the likelihood of accidents or other negative events based on historical data.To maintain data privacy, the risk score of individual parameters will be collected locally and sent to a central server using federated learning algorithms. Federated learning allows the model to be trained on the aggregated data from all entities without transferring any sensitive data to the server. Instead, only the updated model parameters are shared, ensuring data privacy and security.

The proposed approach will enable the development of an effective ML model that can accurately calculate the risk score for drivers, vehicles, routes, and fleet telematics companies while preserving data privacy and security. This will provide valuable insights to companies in the transportation industry, enabling them to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate risk.

## 3. Contextual Advertising in Live Streaming Videos

**Problem Statement:** Advertising has become ubiquitous in the internet community and more so in the ever-growing and popular online video delivery websites (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo). Video advertising is becoming increasingly popular on these websites as it has the most user engagement levels. Platforms like YouTube, however, seldom have contextually relevant ads, which makes the ads extremely annoying to watch. Live streaming has become a new form of entertainment, which attracts hundreds of millions of users worldwide. The huge amount of multimedia data in live streaming platforms creates tremendous opportunities for online advertising. However, existing state-of-the-art video advertising strategies (e.g., pre-roll and contextual mid-roll advertising) that rely on analyzing the whole video, are not applicable to live streaming videos. We propose a framework that will display contextually relevant ads at appropriate times during live-streams in a non-intrusive way, using deep neural networks and natural language processing.

## 6. Music Generation using AI

**Problem Statement:** There are a few key distinctions between creating music and creating images and movies. First, as music is a time-based art, a temporal model is required. Last but not least, polyphonic music frequently groups notes into chords, arpeggios, or melodies, making it unnatural to introduce a chronological ordering of notes. In this paper, we present a paradigm for creating symbolic multi-track music using Transformers and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We have trained the model with constructs of piano-rolls of five tracks, including bass, drums, guitar, piano, and strings. This dataset is known as the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset and was used to train the models on a dataset of more than 100,000 bars of rock music. We demonstrate that our models are capable of creating original and coherent music from scratch.

### 1. Traffic Forecasting with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks

**Problem Statement:** Traffic forecasting is a critical component of effective transportation planning, resource allocation, and urban development strategies. Accurate predictions of traffic volumes,both spatially and temporally, hold the potential to optimize traffic management, alleviate congestion, and enhance overall transportation efficiency. However,conventional methods for traffic prediction often struggle to capture the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in traffic data, relying on simplistic machine learning models or statistical approaches that fail to effectively model the complex network structures and dynamic patterns present in transportation systems. The objective of this study is to forecast traffic volumes for all traffic stations in the region for the upcoming hour, utilizing historical traffic data, as well as contextual features such as month, weekday, and hour of the day as input. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of GNNs, the proposed model aims to outperform conventional traffic prediction approaches and provide valuable insights for transportation planning and management in the Vestlandet region.

### 3. Prompting LLMs with Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Reasoning

**Problem Statement:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, showcasing remarkable abilities in text generation and comprehension. However, their reliance on statistical patterns learned from massive text corpora often leads to shortcomings in factual accuracy and real-world reasoning. To address this, researchers have explored integrating external knowledge sources, with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) emerging as a promising avenue. KGs represent entities and their relationships in a structured format, offering a rich source of factual information. Several existing approaches leverage KGs to enhance LLMs. Fine-tuning LLMs on KG-derived data allows them to learn relationships between entities, but this process can be computationally expensive and requires retraining for specific domains. Alternatively, knowledge distillation techniques aim o transfer knowledge from a KG to an LLM, but their effectiveness relies heavily on the chosen distillation method.

### 5. Comparative Study between Federated Learning and Medical Data

**Problem Statement:** Centralised machine learning models have been widely used for predictive modelling tasks across a variety of domains, including healthcare. These models are trained on aggregated datasets stored in a central server. Yet, worries about scalability, security, and privacy of data have prompted the investigation of substitute strategies. A decentralised machine learning paradigm called federated learning has drawn interest as a possible way to overcome these obstacles. Federated Learning provides an attractive framework for collaborative predictive modelling by enabling model training to be done locally on dispersed 20 data sources while protecting personal information. In this work, there is a showcase of comparative analysis using Federated Learning for mental health prediction between decentralised and centralised models. The goal is to compare the two methods' performance on a shared dataset and determine their relative advantages and disadvantages. By contrasting it with conventional centralised models, this paper makes use of effectiveness of federated learning in the context of mental health prediction. By conducting this comparative analysis, the project seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the application of machine learning techniques in mental health prediction and provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field. A range of data sources are used by machine learning algorithms to predict mental health, such as social media activity, behavioural patterns, medical history, and demographic data. By using advanced techniques to find patterns and correlations in the data, these algorithms allow for highly accurate prediction of mental health outcomes..

### 6. An Artificial Intelligence Based Approach towards enhanced storytelling for children

**Problem Statement:** Great progress has been seen in the last few years in the development of large language models (LLMs). Such models have capabilities of producing automatically generated educational materials purposed to be used by children. However,one big challenge in this is ensuring that the automatically generated material is communicable to a young learner. LLMs generate text well, but struggle to come up with words and sentence constructions that could befit children, meaning that even if it could generate a story, the created story could not fit for kids. LLMs are good in producing stories that can be read easily and have children's vocabulary at a rate appropriate for them. In that light, a research is required to test this extent. The results showed that LLMs perform well in text generation but are incapable of adjusting their language such that the younger readers understand it. That is to mean, realizing the need for the usage of visual storytelling in children's learning, it was also put forward that images can be taken together with the stories that are written down. The goal was to improve children's understanding and interest by using both words and pictures. The goal is to find an approach and findings of a study that sought to examine how language models work with image generation to make the production of educational content suited for kids more effective. This brings together various areas of study, namely, intending to work on making these learning environments motivational and accessible for the smallest children.

### 7. Enhancing Neural Machine Translation Quality through Adversarial Training with Generative Adversarial Networks

**Problem Statement:** The problem statement focuses on improving a transformer model that has been specially trained for the English→Marathi translation problem. The finetuning procedure is a systematic approach aimed at optimizing the model's performance, ensuring that it accurately and efficiently captures every aspect of languagetranslation. It is not the same as previous approaches that aim at optimizing the possibility of human translations. Adversarial-NMT employs an adversarial training architecture wherein the NMT model is jointly learned with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) acting as the adversary. The primary objective of the adversary is to distinguish translations produced by the NMT model from those produced by humans. To fool the adversary, the NMT model seeks to generate precise translations in the interim. Training simultaneously optimizes the NMT model and the adversary using a policy gradient technique. Test assessments on the English→Marathi translation assignment show that Adversarial-NMT surpasses many robust baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in improving translation quality. This highlights threat potential of GANs in developing NMT techniques.
